                <h2>Introduction:</h2>
                <p>So you want to try and spin rifles, huh? Well luckily for you, you came to the right place! This website will give you a small guide to performing basic spins that can be performed with either a demilitarized rifle, or for all of the people living on a college campus, a long umbrella.</p>
                <p>Firstly, let me start with explaining the possible danger of the sport. Spinning rifles is by no means the kind of sport you can go to the backyard and toss with your dad (of course, unless you both have the knowledge to transfer rifles, then by all means go ahead). It takes a lot of practice and dedication, as well as the full understanding that you could cut or hurt yourself pretty bad if you rush in trying to toss a 9 pound rifle as high as you possibly can. However, I don't want to discourage you, because spinning rifles and exhibition drill in general is a wonderful and rewarding sport that I highly encourage you to pursue. </p>
                <p>Secondly, exhibition drill is best performed as a team, based on my experience. Although there is the opportunity to conduct a solo exhibition drill performance, having a team to practice and challenge eachother to become better every practice at drill is by far one of the biggest reason I continued to be part of some sort of drill team for about 5 years now. For those of you that are looking to apply this little bit of knowledge in a team enviornment, then wonderful! Those of you who are looking to become the best solo exhibition performer, don't feel like I'm trying to segregate you from what I said before. Whatever level of skill you have, whether you're on a team or flying solo, as long as you have the drive and motivation to practice and improve, I welcome you and hope you enjoy this little guide. </p>
