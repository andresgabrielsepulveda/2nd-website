                <h2>Equipment:</h2>
                <p>Exhibition drill is a decently cheap sport as compared to big time sports like Soccer and Football. If you learn to take care of your equipment effectively, you'll have a rifle that will last you for years before it's "unserviceable". </p>
                <p>And with that, you might be asking: "What kind of rifle do I use? Can I just go ahead and buy a hunting rifle and start spinning it in my backyard?"</p>
                <p>The answer to the first question will be answered soon, however the answer to the second question is NO. When spinning rifles, you want to understand that most of these rifles actually DO NOT have any ammunition or any way of firing in the first place. The reason being is that the shock of either you catching it from the air, or the shock of the rifle hitting the ground, chances are if it's loaded, it will most definitely fire and injure you or others. For that reason, I extremely urge you to use a replica or demilitarized rifle, to mitigate the possible chances of bullet holes in anything.</p>
                <h3>Example Rifles:</h3>
                <p>Now to answer the first question you might've had. Below are some examples of what most drill teams use, whether they are Junior ROTC , ROTC , Military Drill Teams/Honor Guards, aspiring soloists, or anywhere between:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Most Popular: M1903 Springfield
                        <ul>
                            <li>From my experience, this has been the most widely used and reliable rifle to perform exhibition drill with. The shape of the rifle, from my experience, is ergonomic and makes the spinning and maneuvering of it much easier than some other rifles. I spun with some form of a Springfield for 4 years of my drill team career and by all means I can say it hasn't let me down once. There are different "variants" that have their ups and downs, and i've found with my experience that Daisy Springfields tend to be the best option for both weight and stability, although the Demil and DrillAmerica variants also have their reasons to be great choices as well.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        M1 Garand
                        <ul>
                            <li> I've only recently in the past year had the chance to utilize this rifle for actual Exhibition Drill, all of the Drill Teams/Honor Guards I was a part of/knew about before had either used Springfields or used the M1 for Color Guard performances. Last year however, I came to a unit where they EXCLUSIVELY used M1's for Drill and Color Guard. It was definitely a learning experience, and now I'm used to using the M1 for most of my spins.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Overall, I would say that if you could, try to have a chance to try out different rifles to get a feel for which one is best for you and/or your team. I learned to be able to spin with both the M1 and the Springfield, and it made me a better driller for learning, so I highly encourage either of the two. Just don't go telling anyone I told you to buy two rifles instead of just one.</p>
                <h3>Alternatives:</h3>
                <p>Some of us might have situations where we can't just go and keep a rifle, albeit demilitarized, for whatever reason, and we might want an alternative to a rifle to be able to spin wherever we like without worrying on someone calling the police on us. In this section, I'll go over some alternatives I've used in order to practice when a rifle wasn't readily available. Keep in mind for most cases, the alternative won't necessarily replace the actual thing, at most these will help you to memorize spins and things with lighter alternatives to a rifle.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Long Umbrellas
                        <ul>
                            <li> It may seem funny that I put this at the top of the list, but in all honesty, it really is that useful. I keep about 2 or 3 long umbrellas taped up with electrical tape to maintain its shape and keep it together basically. 
                            </li>
                            <li>Pros:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Ease of Access - An umbrella is a lot more easy to have than a rifle ever could be. Noone is going to call the cops on a guy carrying an umbrella unless you use it as a weapon, which I wouldn't understand, considering how the whole point of you using an umbrella is so that you aren't having the cops on you.</li>
                                <li>Shape - The shape of a long umbrella is pretty close to a rifle, if you think about it. This allows you to spin it pretty effectively and closely to the same style that you would with a rifle. Don't use an umbrella as a replacement, however, you'll find out pretty quickly that certain spins aren't possible with a rifle that are with an umbrella.
                                </li>
                                <li>Cost - One of the main reasons this is at the top of the list is because of how cheap it can be to get a long umbrella if you look hard enough. Compared to about 300$ to get a rifle, it's a great alternative while you save up money.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Cons:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Too Light - Although it is great for some spinning practice, the umbrella itself is pretty light and unless you have some resistance bands wrapped to your wrist in order to simulate the weight of a rifle, it's most likely that you'll get used to the umbrella's weight if you use it too much and end up having possible trouble throwing the rifle as much as you could have, which was a problem of mine. My advice is to use an umbrella sparingly, don't necessarily use it all the time for practice unless you have a way to supplement the weight safely.
                                </li>
                                <li> Material - The material that is used to make an umbrella is slippery and can be dangerous. I combatted this possible danger by using electrical tape to create a sort of grip in certain spots of the umbrella, and you can do this with either electrical tape or simple duct tape, which might be better since it has a little more traction.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Overall, I would say that the umbrella is a great preliminary option for spinning for any level of drill. Keep in mind that the ability to spin is partly due to you getting used to the weight of a rifle, and practicing with a lighter weight won't necessarily help you with actually performing the spin itself. However, it can help with learning the hand placement necessary in order to spin with a real rifle, which is why I highly recommend it.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Padded Metal Pipe (Or Drill Stick)
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Coming at a close second, I put this option on the list because of it's ability to improve handling of the rifle immensely. Essentially it's a metal pipe with some padding around it that weighs about 10 pounds. I acquired mine from <a href="#">paradestore.com</a>, however I'm sure you could make your own for cheap if it came down to it.</p>
